----Rules----

When a chesspiece has been selected, it must be moved. If it cannot be moved, another chesspiece is allowed. 

King specific rule(s):
  Castling is a kingmove.

If the king is check, only pieces that can prevent the check can be moved. 
Pieces that are keeping the king safe from hostile pieces cannot be moved in such a way that the king comes under check.

The game will draw automatically if no piece has been captured and no pawn has been moved the last 70 turns.
