Bugs:
At some point a pawn stated it could block a hostile piece from checking the king, even though the y difference was 3. The pawn had not moved. - Should be fixed
At some point the king could not move. The only white piece that was not on its default location was the pawn above the king. It had been taken. The only hostile piece above the king was a pawn on its start location.
	- So far not been replicated. 

If a, non-moved, pawn tries to move and cannot, because something is in front of it, it cannot double move anymore. - Fixed

Black king was under threat by a white knight. Black knight could not take it, even though it should, and black pawns would move up instead of down. - Fixed

All the place that are using Rock should using Rook...

White queen checkmated the black king in offline play. Game endscreen stated it was a draw.

Fixed a bug in CheckmateChecker().QRBCheck() that did not allow a piece to stand between the king and the hostile one if the piece could capture the hostile piece.
	The bug happens for the knight too. - Fixed

	
                Current bug: the black knight was between the black queen and white king and yet it could still move.
					worked when the knight was right next to the king, but not futher up. Every other time it has been right next to the queen.
						Fixed, it did not check in the straight directions.
                Bug regarding the CheckmateChecker(). The white knight cannot jump to be between the white king and black queen. Other pieces could move to be between - fixed
				Fixed a bug that meant a piece could not stand between the king and a threatning piece if there was only one square between them.
