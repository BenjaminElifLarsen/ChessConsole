Ideas--------------------------
Each chess piece should have accesss to a matrix of the board. 
0's being the black side and 1's being the white size
Use to check the location of enemies and allies, since the type does not matter to most pieces.
	When a piece moves, it should updates it own location in the matrix too.
Only the king needs to care about the types since it needs to figure out if it can move to a location and/or if it is treated by another piece. 
	Maybe instead of 0's and 1's, use an sbyte. If positive it is black and negative is white. 
	Each type got it own value, e.g. king is +-1, queen is +-2, bishop is +-3, knight is +-4, rock is +-6 and pawn is +-6
